[ RR2 Documentation: Configuration files ]

Configuration files in RR2 follow the python ConfigParser format: they are organized into sections, in which key-value pairs indicate options. The sections correspond to different option categories. Sections are indicated by square brackets:
[section_name]
and options are indicated using the option name and the value:
option: value

Comments can be made by starting a line with #.

That's it for the brief explanation of the config format (see http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html for more detail), now for the actual files and the options contained within them.

<main.cfg>
The most important config file, this contains all the options that define gameplay, units and others. It should have at least the following sections:
[main]
[wall_types]
as well as a section for every object type.

<The [main] section>

The [main] section is... well, the main section. This is where other config files are linked, objects are listed, and other stuff is done.
Options:
includes - lists other config files to include. May be removed in future because it was a stupid idea.
objects - lists almost all* the object types that can exist in game. Each of these should have a section matching with the object name defined here.
testing_map - used only during testing and will be removed later on. Gives the path to a map to load immediately on startup.
wall_config_file - gives path to the walls.cfg file, which defines wall types. See <walls.cfg>.

* Some objects are hard-coded (sorry, modders...) for simplicity's sake, such as energy crystals and ore. But don't worry, we do have a section that will help you mod those at least a little:

<The [basic_objects] section>

This defines the models etc. for the object types that have been hardcoded.

<Object sections>

There should be one for every object, matching the object's name as defined in the [main] section.
Object properties:
hp - Amount of health an object has. Set to 0 to make it indestructible.
name - Full name of an object as shown in game.
speed - Walking speed of an object. 100 is the default speed for a rock raider.
info - Short summary of the function or actions of an object. Recommended length: 5-20 words
model - Path to the object's model
ai - AI settings for the object. Values are full, semi and off. Full makes an object impossible to select and puts it fully under the AI's control (monsters etc.). Semi makes it act intuitively while allowing the player to control it. Off makes it fully dependent on the player to give it commands and disables all but the most basic AI (pathfinding, etc.)
tool_user - Whether the object can use tools. By default, rock raiders are the only objects to have this set to yes.
hostile - Whether the object will attack players' units and buildings. Not recommended if ai is not set to full.
